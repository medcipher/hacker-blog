# 🚀 **How to Get Started in Ethical Hacking & Cybersecurity**

If you're new to hacking and cybersecurity, the best approach is to start with **structured learning**, then apply what you learn through **hands-on challenges** like Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. Here’s a step-by-step guide to getting started the right way.

---

## **1️⃣ Learn the Basics of Computers & Networking**
Before diving into hacking, you need to understand **how computers and networks work**.

### **📌 Key Concepts to Learn**
- **Operating Systems:** Learn Linux (especially Kali Linux) and Windows internals.
- **Networking Fundamentals:** Understand **IP addresses, ports, firewalls, and protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, etc.).**
- **Command Line Mastery:** Learn how to use the **Linux terminal & Bash commands** effectively.
- **Programming Basics:** Learn **Python, Bash scripting, and basic web languages (HTML, JavaScript, SQL)** for hacking.

### **🛠 Best Free Resources**
- 🎓 **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)** – Teaches programming & Linux.
- 📖 **[Computer Networking Course (Stanford)](https://cs144.github.io/)** – Free high-quality networking course.
- 🐧 **[OverTheWire: Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)** – Learn Linux basics by hacking.
- 🖥️ **[TryHackMe: Introduction to Cybersecurity](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoinfosec)** – Hands-on hacking lab for total beginners.

---

## **2️⃣ Set Up Your Ethical Hacking Lab**
You need a **safe environment** to practice hacking. Never test hacks on **real websites or networks without permission**—that’s illegal.

### **🛠 What You Need**
✅ **VirtualBox or VMware** – Virtualization software to run different OSes.  
✅ **Kali Linux** – A penetration testing OS with pre-installed hacking tools.  
✅ **Metasploitable** – A deliberately vulnerable machine for practicing exploits.  
✅ **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App)** – A web app designed for learning web security flaws.

### **📌 How to Set It Up**
1. **Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or VMware.**
2. **Download [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms) & set it up in a VM.**
3. **Get vulnerable machines like [Metasploitable](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/) to practice on.**
4. **Use [DVWA](http://dvwa.co.uk/) to learn web security basics.**

💡 **Once your lab is set up, you can safely practice exploits!**

## **3️⃣ Start Learning Hacking Techniques**
Once you understand **networking & Linux**, start learning **how hackers think** by exploring different attack methods.

### **🔍 Core Hacking Techniques to Learn**
- **Reconnaissance & OSINT** – How hackers gather information before an attack.
- **Web Application Hacking** – SQL injection, XSS, and web exploitation.
- **Network Penetration Testing** – Wi-Fi hacking, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
- **Social Engineering** – Phishing, pretexting, and human hacking techniques.

### **🛠 Best Free Hands-On Hacking Resources**
- 🕵️‍♂️ **[Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/)** – Play hacking challenges & solve real-world penetration testing labs.
- 🎯 **[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)** – Interactive learning paths from beginner to expert.
- 🏴‍☠️ **[picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/)** – Beginner-friendly Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.
- 💻 **[CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/)** – Find live hacking competitions to test your skills.

## **4️⃣ Learn How to Document Your Hacking Progress**
Hacking is a skill **best learned through hands-on practice**, but documentation is **key** for growth.

### **🔹 Why Document Your Work?**
✅ **Reinforces what you learn.**  
✅ **Builds your online portfolio.**  
✅ **Helps you get into bug bounty or cybersecurity jobs.**

### **📌 How to Get Started**
1. **Create a GitHub account** – Document CTFs & hacking notes.
2. **Write blog posts** – Share solutions for hacking challenges.
3. **Join cybersecurity communities** – Engage with others in hacking forums like `r/netsec` on Reddit.
